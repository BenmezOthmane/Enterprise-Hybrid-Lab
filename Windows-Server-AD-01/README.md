##  Phase 1: Installation & Troubleshooting
During the initial setup in VMware Workstation, a critical issue was encountered that prevented the OS installation.

###  The Problem: "No Images Available"
Upon reaching the operating system selection screen, the installer displayed an error: **"No images are available"**. This was likely due to a conflict with the virtual hard disk controller type or the initial disk configuration.

###  The Solution: Disk Reconfiguration
To resolve this, I performed the following troubleshooting steps:
1. **Hard Disk Removal:** Deleted the existing virtual hard disk from the VM settings.
2. **New Disk Creation:** Added a new Hard Disk via the **Add Hardware Wizard**.
3. **Controller Type:** Specifically selected **SATA** to ensure compatibility.
4. **Capacity & Allocation:** Set a **40 GB** maximum disk size and chose to **split the virtual disk into multiple files** for better performance and portability.

> ![Final Disk Setup](Windows-Server-AD-01/Screenshots/Scr add hard disk 1.png)

###  Result
After reconfiguring the disk hardware, the installer successfully identified the drive, allowing the installation to proceed.

##  Phase 2: Network & DNS Configuration
[cite_start]After a successful OS installation, the server was hardened with a static network identity to support **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** and **DNS**.

### IP Addressing Plan:
- **Static IP:** `10.0.0.10`
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.0.0.0`
- **Default Gateway:** `10.0.0.1`
- **Preferred DNS:** `10.0.0.10` (Self-referencing for AD roles)
